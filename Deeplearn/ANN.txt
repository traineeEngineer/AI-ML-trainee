ANN
===========
important steps to ANN:
1.Featre Scalling->q1:which all algorithms feature scalling is required?
                      1:Linear regression
                      2:ANN
                      3:Logistic regression
                      4:KNN regression
                      5:KMeans

                      Anything which is related to distance based problem and Gradient descent optimerzer used alogo 
                      scalling is required


Seqential:ANN also has layers in sequential order and the data flows from one layer
          to another layer in the given order until the data finally reaches the output layer.   

Dense : to create input layer hidden layer and output layer

Activation:it is function which is used in hidden layers 

Dropout: some times our data will get overfitting problem occur so we reduce overfitting to use dropout layer 
         this is like regularization paramerter

Early stopping: when montitored metric has stopped improving

=====================================================================================================================
Blackbox model vs whitebox model:
-----------------------------------

when difficult to monitor such thing like weights, trees are under the Blackbox model some of the algorithms 
are Random forest,ANN,XGboost

when montitored such things easily is under white box model some algorithm are Linear regreesion,decision trees

understanding CNN:
----------------------
Convolution:

In a image we have a vlaue are range between 0-255 so we need to scale that rane between 
0-1 and after pass the filter/kernal is called horizintal edge filter and get output

Convolution operation happens take filter place to top left start position and that filter and
actual image pixel we already scalled get multiplied each one cell and the final output will 
be place at first position of final image 

and filter jump one position to right that we may called Stride ,if stride value is Anything
filter can jump at position and do another multiplcation and add output to the final image value
                      
                    =>values be like :filter value{0,0,0,....} , actual image values{0,0,0....}
                                      multiply both actua and filter value and add like this
                                      (0*0,0*0,....)=(0+0...)
formula of spliting image 
 when we have 6x6 iamge and filter have 3x3 and final output will be 4x4
        formlua= n-f+1(  =>f is filter)

        upadte formlua if stride > 1 =>n+2p-f+1/s

we use above formlua our final output image will be shrink or loss so to prevent this type of loss
to use padding technique 
padding is used to build a compound around a image 

what is importance of padding?
to prevent information loss on image so we use different kind of padding technique.

note: initially we apply random filter for the image but through back propagation we have
      to update filter based on input image 

      after Convolution operation when ever get output topof each ond every value we apply relu or prelu function

Maxpooling:


Flattening layer : combine all filter output
