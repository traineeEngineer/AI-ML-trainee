Jal gaya tha,"Arre bhai, samajh gaya. Koi baat nahi, agli baar dekhte hain kaise kar sakte hain."
Naaam bada darshan chota not satisfied with this recipe lots of mistake,"Understood, we all make the necessary adjustments"
bakwash,maafi yaar. Next time behtar koshish karenge
chiii mene try ki ghr pr  biryani ki naam ki insult h ye plzz guys koi try mt krna ghr pr,"Samajh gaya, shayad kuch gadbad ho gayi hogi. Aage se try nahi karenge, koi baat nahi."
I dont like this biriyani,I understand. We will make sure to improve it next time
Lolllll Yeh biryani Hai ya sabji Ese Todhi na Banti Hai pagal biryani,maafi yaar. Lagta hai kuch gadbad ho gayi. Agli baar behtar try karenge
badi mushkil h,kuch cheezein thodi mushkil hoti hain. Par hum try karenge aur behtar karenge.
