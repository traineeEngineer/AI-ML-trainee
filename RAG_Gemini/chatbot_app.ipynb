This distribution typically goes towards charitable causes, mosques, educational institutions, or other specified beneficiaries.\\n    * **Enforcement:**  Ensuring that the Waqf property is used in accordance with the original intention of the \"waqif\" and that the beneficiaries receive the benefits they are entitled to.\\n\\n**Waqf boards can operate at various levels:**\\n\\n* **National level:** Many countries have national Waqf boards that oversee Waqf properties and regulate their administration.\\n* **Local level:** Some countries also have local Waqf boards that manage Waqf properties within specific regions or cities.\\n\\n**Significance of Waqf Boards:**\\n\\n* **Preservation of Islamic values:** Waqf boards play a vital role in upholding Islamic principles of charity, social justice, and community development.\\n* **Sustainable development:**  By managing Waqf properties effectively, boards ensure their long-term sustainability and the continued benefit of the community.\\n* **Social welfare:**  Waqf boards contribute to the well-being of society by funding various social programs, such as education, healthcare, and poverty alleviation.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that the specific functions and structure of Waqf boards can vary depending on the country and its legal framework. \\n'"
